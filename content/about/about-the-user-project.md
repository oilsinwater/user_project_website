The Superbloom team researched over the course of 6-8 months from September 2022 until May 2023 around how usability and design presents in scientific open source software, with the goal of investigating what are the conditions that enable scientific open source teams to prioritize and focus on usability successfully. This work is supported by the [Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/).
