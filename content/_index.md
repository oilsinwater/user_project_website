From December 2022 to February 2023, we spoke to research participants who are maintainers, developers, designers, scientists, researchers, funders, Open Source Program Offices and stakeholders â€“ all involved with creating and maintaining Scientific & Research OSS.

We investigated how norms in academic, science, and/or open source working environments affect the choices teams make around their users and different kinds of design interventions how team dynamics and trust affects those choices what teams would need to be interested in or able to prioritize usability in their work. This research is funded by the Sloan Foundation.
