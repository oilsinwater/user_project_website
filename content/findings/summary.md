The Usable Software Ecosystem Research project (USER) is a research initiative that explores how open source scientific and research software (SROSS) teams understand, consider, and undertake usability and design opportunities in their projects. Supported by the Sloan Foundation, our research followed an iterative Human-Centered Design approach using multiple methods of inquiry, including desk research, surveys, interviews, and observation at community events and gatherings between November 2022 and June 2023.

This project illuminated countless insights, from a close look into how a diverse set of SROSS projects and their contributors consider their users, to how they approach the usability and broader design aspects of their projects, to the complex and often contradictory ways in which they understand and build SROSS tools.

Below we’ve crafted a summary of our key findings, which, though significant, fails to contain the true breadth and complexity captured in our complete set of findings. To understand these takeaways in context, please navigate to the linked associated chapters.  You’ll find after each finding there’s suggested sections associated with the findings should you want to discover more about a particular finding and then see associated recommendations that we suggest implementing into your SROSS projects in order to address a challenge present in the finding.
